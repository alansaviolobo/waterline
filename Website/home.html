<span class="black-text">Music is the harmonious voice of creation; an echo of the invisible world.</span>
Unveil the invisible. Join the Waterline academy and awaken to what was only known to you as a metaphor. Think about it, in this whole wide world
 who doesn’t like Music? We are here to make it flow with your soul, to make sure it is discovered within you. <br /> 
<br />
<span class="black-text">After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is Music.</span>
If you are in Pune, you can join our classes currently held at Aundh. You can't realize your adroitness unless you start. You can’t swim until you 
dive, and we train you to swim - Music is just a medium. <br /> 
<br />
<span class="black-text">Music is the universal language of mankind</span>. Age, cast, religion were never the barriers. All countries have percussion
 instruments, the guitar doesn’t care who’s holding it, and keyboards just look for hands... We welcome kids, adults, retired citizens to unleash their
  talent with our Academy.<br /> 
<br />
<span class="black-text">Music is what feelings sound like</span>. Let your feelings speak up. </p>
